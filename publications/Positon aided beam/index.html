          Millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication systems rely on narrow beams to achieve sufficient receive signal
          power. Adjusting these beams is typically associated with large training overhead, which becomes particularly
          critical for highly-mobile applications. Beam selection can benefit from the knowledge of user positions to
          reduce the overhead in mm Wave beam training. Prior work, however, studied this problem using only synthetic
          data that does not accurately represent real-world measurements. In this paper, we revisit the position-aided
          beam prediction problem in light of real-world measurements with commercial-off-the-shelf GPS to derive
          insights into how much beam training overhead can be saved in practice. We also compare algorithms that
          perform well in synthetic data but fail to generalize with real data, and attempt to answer what factors cause
          inference degradation. Further, we propose a machine learning evaluation metric that better captures the end
          communication system objective. This work aims at closing the gap between reality and simulations in
          position-aided beam alignment.

          <!-- In this work, we present a different method based on quadrature
            techniques whose convergence is better than stochastic methods in
            areas with soft illumination. This method works in a deterministic
            way using an adaptive scheme, which allows distributing the work to
            those areas of increased difficulty (given an estimation of the
            scene error), reducing the computation time and increasing the
            accuracy. For this purpose, a data structure optimized for this
            problem is used to minimize the computation time. Finally, the use
            of a hybrid method between the stochastic approach and our proposed
            method, which seeks to take advantage of the benefits of each one
            while combining them, will be studied. We will integrate our
            proposed method into the architecture of the Mitsuba renderer and
            validate it against an established standard technique called Path
            Tracing implemented in this software. -->
